&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; A discord bot system that allows the users to create and manager tickets from one centralized system.
It allows the separation of tickets in categories (by default general, donations, password, and top) as well as to allow
banned users to appeal their ban. As the normal discord ban removes the user completely from the server the system
creates
a custom ban system that does not restrict the user from being able to be present on the server, but it removes all the
roles of the user and gives him a banned role that only has access to the ban appeal ticket.
